How cool it could be if you could turn your Ambernic RG35XX into a wireless Bluetooth joystick by simply loading a program?
I don't think I have the knowledge to do this by myselfe.
My first try was to identify the pressed buttons on a PyGame Script.
But how can I go on?
- See if using an internal Bluetooth chip as a signal is possible.
- Make it be recognized by a PC as a joystick.
- Send the signals?

I am looking for help here as I am not a Python guy.

Best regards !!
