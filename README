How cool could it be if you could turn your Ambernic RG35XX into a wireless bluetooth joystick by simply loading a program ?
I dont think I have the knowlege to do this by my own.
My first try was to identify the pressed buttons on a PyGame Script.
But how can I go on ?
- See if it is possible to use internal bluetooth chip as a signal ?
- Make it be recognized by a PC as a joystick ?
- Send the signals ?

I am looking for help here as I am not a python guy.

Best regards !!
